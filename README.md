# JP-MORGAN-TASKS 

There are three tasks in total. The first task is about "Interface with a stock price data feed". The second task is about "Use JPMorgan Chase & Co. frameworks and tools". Finally, the third task is about " Display data visually for traders". For each task I have attached the code and the solution patch file.
